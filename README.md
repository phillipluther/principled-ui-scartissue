# principled-ui

> A deeply personal and specifically handy component library so I can stop making so damned many buttons.

... "buttons," of course, being a metaphor for all the fiddly, repetitive UI elements used in every project. Inputs. Modals. Dropdown menus.

You get it.

Until declared otherwise, this library targets an audience of one -- its author. Maybe someday it'll open up.
